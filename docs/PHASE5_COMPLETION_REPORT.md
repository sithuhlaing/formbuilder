### **Integration Architecture**

#### **New Application Flow:**
```
App.tsx (Simple) → SimpleFormBuilder → 
├── SimpleComponentPalette (drag sources)
├── SimpleCanvas (drop targets + rendering)
├── SimpleDraggableComponent (individual items)
└── SimpleRenderer (direct React elements)
```

#### **Data Flow:**
```
useSimpleFormBuilder (React useState) →
SimpleFormBuilder (props) →  
Child Components (direct props) →
React Elements (direct rendering)
```
