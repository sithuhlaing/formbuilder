## 1. Introduction/Overview

### Problem Statement

Organizations and individuals frequently need to create custom forms for data collection, surveys, applications, and workflows. Traditional approaches require either:
- **Manual coding** by developers (expensive, time-consuming, inflexible)
- **Generic form tools** that lack customization and control
- **Complex enterprise solutions** with steep learning curves and high costs

This creates significant barriers for:
- **Non-technical users** who need to quickly create professional forms without coding
- **Developers** who spend excessive time building repetitive form UIs
- **Organizations** that depend heavily on development resources for simple form creation

### Solution

A modern, drag-and-drop form builder application that empowers both technical and non-technical users to visually design complex forms through an intuitive interface. The solution provides a fast, simple, and beautiful tool for creating forms that work offline and handle large-scale forms (100+ fields).

**Key Value Proposition:** Reduce form creation time by 70-80% while requiring zero coding knowledge.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)

The following features are **explicitly excluded** from the initial MVP release:

### ❌ Backend Integration
- **No form submission handling** - Forms only export structure, not submission logic
- **No database integration** - No direct database connections or data storage
- **No email notifications** - No automated emails on form submission
- **No webhooks** - No integration with external APIs

**Rationale:** MVP focuses on form *design*, not form *processing*. Users export JSON and integrate with their own backends.

### ❌ Advanced Conditional Logic
- **No conditional field visibility** - No "show field B if field A = X" logic
- **No calculated fields** - No automatic field calculations
- **No complex validation rules** - Only basic required/pattern validation
- **No multi-step conditional routing** - No dynamic page flow based on answers

**Rationale:** Adds significant complexity. Can be added in Phase 2 after validating core MVP.

### ❌ Analytics & Reporting
- **No form analytics** - No tracking of form views/submissions
- **No completion rate tracking** - No metrics on partial vs complete submissions
- **No A/B testing** - No variant testing of forms
- **No response dashboards** - No visualization of form data

**Rationale:** Out of scope for design tool. Users integrate with their own analytics.

### ❌ Collaboration Features
- **No multi-user editing** - No real-time collaboration
- **No comments/annotations** - No team discussion on forms
- **No version control** - No branching/merging of form versions
- **No sharing/permissions** - No user access control

**Rationale:** MVP is single-user focused. Enterprise features come in Phase 4.

### ❌ Advanced Layout Features
- **No CSS grid builder** - No complex grid layouts
- **No absolute positioning** - No free-form component placement
- **No custom themes** - Only light/dark mode, no brand customization
- **No responsive breakpoint editor** - No custom responsive rules

**Rationale:** Keeps UI simple and predictable. Advanced layout in Phase 2.

## 6. Design Considerations

### UI/UX Principles

1. **Simple and Intuitive** - Minimal learning curve, no documentation required
2. **Modern and Beautiful** - Professional appearance out of the box
3. **Fast Performance** - Instant feedback, no loading spinners
4. **Mobile-Friendly** - Works seamlessly on all devices

### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme:** Primary blue (#007bff), clean whites/grays
- **Typography:** System fonts for fast loading
- **Dark Mode:** Full theme support (toggle in header)
- **Icons:** Minimal icon usage, clear text labels
- **Spacing:** Generous padding for touch targets (44px min)

### Component Design System

**Three-Panel Layout:**
```
┌─────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────┐
│  Component  │                      │  Properties  │
│   Palette   │       Canvas         │    Panel     │
│  (Left)     │      (Center)        │   (Right)    │
│             │                      │              │
│  - Input    │   Drag components    │  - Label     │
│  - Select   │   here to build      │  - Required  │
│  - Layout   │   your form          │  - Validation│
│  - UI       │                      │  - Options   │
└─────────────┴──────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Desktop: > 1024px (three-panel layout)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (collapsible panels)
- Mobile: < 768px (single panel with navigation)

### Drag-Drop Visual Feedback

- **Dragging from Palette:** Semi-transparent preview follows cursor
- **Drop Zones:** Blue dashed border on hover
- **Valid Drop:** Green highlight
- **Invalid Drop:** Red highlight with shake animation

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework:**
- Next.js 15 (React 19)
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4

**State Management:**
- React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- Context API for global state
- localStorage for persistence

**Drag-and-Drop:**
- React DnD with HTML5 Backend
- Custom drop zone calculations

**Build Tools:**
- Vite (development server)
- Turbopack (production builds)

### Offline Support Implementation

**Storage Strategy:**
- **localStorage** for templates (5MB limit)
- **IndexedDB** for large forms (future)
- **Service Worker** for offline caching (future)

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// templateService.ts
const STORAGE_KEY = 'form_builder_templates';

export const saveTemplate = (template: FormTemplate) => {
  const templates = getTemplates();
  templates.push(template);
  localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(templates));
};
```

### Performance Requirements

**Large Form Handling (100+ fields):**
- Virtual scrolling for component list (future optimization)
- Lazy loading of property panels
- Debounced property updates (300ms)
- Memoized component renderers

**Bundle Size Targets:**
- Initial load: < 300KB gzipped
- Main bundle: < 500KB gzipped
- Code splitting for property panels

### Data Models

**Component Interface:**
```typescript
interface Component {
  id: string;
  type: ComponentType;
  label: string;
  required?: boolean;
  placeholder?: string;
  defaultValue?: string | number | boolean | string[];
  options?: Array<{ label: string; value: string }>;
  children?: Component[]; // For layout components
  validation?: {
    required?: boolean;
    pattern?: string;
    minLength?: number;
    maxLength?: number;
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
    message?: string;
  };
  style?: React.CSSProperties;
  className?: string;
  fieldId?: string;
}
```

**Template Interface:**
```typescript
interface FormTemplate {
  templateName: string;
  pages?: Array<{
    title: string;
    components: Component[];
  }>;
  components: Component[]; // Backward compatibility
  version: string;
  metadata?: {
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt: string;
    author?: string;
  };
}
```

### Export Formats

**JSON Schema Export:**
```json
{
  "templateName": "Contact Form",
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "comp_1",
      "type": "text_input",
      "label": "Full Name",
      "required": true,
      "fieldId": "fullName"
    }
  ],
  "version": "2.0"
}
```

**React Component Export (Future):**
```jsx
export const ContactForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="fullName"
        placeholder="Full Name"
        required
      />
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Integration Points

**Backend Integration:**
- Export JSON schema
- Backend validates against schema
- Backend processes form submissions

**No direct backend dependency** - Form builder is 100% client-side
