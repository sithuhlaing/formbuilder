## 1. Introduction/Overview

### Problem Statement
Organizations currently face significant challenges in creating forms, surveys, and workflows:
- **Internal teams** (marketing, HR, operations) depend on developers to create simple forms, causing bottlenecks and delays
- **End users** need intuitive tools to build surveys and questionnaires without technical expertise
- **Developers** spend valuable time on repetitive form-building tasks instead of core product development
- **Existing solutions** lack the flexibility to handle multiple use cases (forms, surveys, workflows) in one unified system

### Solution
The Visual Form Builder is a drag-and-drop interface that empowers non-technical users to create professional forms, surveys, and workflows without writing code. The system provides:
- Intuitive visual canvas with drag-and-drop component placement
- Advanced horizontal and vertical layout system for sophisticated designs
- Multi-page form support for complex data collection
- Template system for reusability and standardization
- JSON export capability for headless integration with existing systems

### Goal
Democratize form creation by providing a powerful yet easy-to-use visual builder that reduces developer dependency by 80% while maintaining flexibility for complex use cases.

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User: Non-Technical Business User

#### Core Form Building
**US-001**: As a marketing manager, I want to drag components from a palette onto a canvas so that I can build a contact form without coding.

**US-002**: As an HR coordinator, I want to arrange form components horizontally (side-by-side) so that I can create compact, professional-looking forms that match our brand guidelines.

**US-003**: As an operations specialist, I want to create multi-page forms so that I can organize complex data collection into logical sections.

**US-004**: As a researcher, I want to add validation rules to form fields so that I collect accurate data without technical support.

#### Template Management
**US-005**: As a marketing manager, I want to save my form as a reusable template so that my team can create consistent forms for campaigns.

**US-006**: As a team lead, I want to browse and load existing templates so that I don't recreate forms from scratch.

**US-007**: As an administrator, I want to export form templates as JSON so that developers can integrate them into our applications.

#### Layout Flexibility
**US-008**: As a designer, I want to position components vertically and horizontally in the same form so that I can create sophisticated layouts that match mockups.

**US-009**: As a form creator, I want the system to automatically organize components into rows when I place them side-by-side so that I don't manage complex layout logic manually.

**US-010**: As a power user, I want to rearrange existing components by dragging them to new positions so that I can iterate on my design quickly.

#### Domain-Specific Needs
**US-011**: As a survey creator, I want access to question-focused components (text input, radio groups, checkboxes) so that I can build surveys without irrelevant components cluttering the interface.

**US-012**: As a workflow designer, I want to create step-based processes with buttons and actions so that I can guide users through multi-step procedures.

**US-013**: As a form administrator, I want the builder to adapt its terminology based on my use case (fields vs. questions vs. steps) so that the interface feels natural for my specific domain.

#### Error Recovery & History
**US-014**: As a form builder, I want to undo my last 50 actions so that I can experiment freely without fear of breaking my form.

**US-015**: As a form creator, I want clear error messages when I make mistakes (like exceeding layout limits) so that I understand how to fix issues.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

The following features are explicitly **NOT** included in this release:

### NG-001: Form Submission Handling
Backend processing of form submissions (data storage, email notifications, webhooks) is out of scope. The builder only creates form definitions.

### NG-002: User Authentication & Authorization
User management, login systems, and permission controls for the builder itself are not included. Assumes existing authentication system integration.

### NG-003: Form Analytics & Reporting
Tracking submission metrics, conversion rates, and analytics dashboards are out of scope.

### NG-004: Payment Integration
Payment processing, payment gateway integration, or e-commerce features are not included.

### NG-005: Advanced Conditional Logic
Complex if-then rules, branching logic, or dynamic field showing/hiding based on user responses are deferred to future releases.

### NG-006: Third-Party Integrations
Direct integrations with external services (Zapier, webhooks, CRM systems) are out of scope.

### NG-007: Custom Styling/Theming
Advanced visual customization beyond basic component properties (custom CSS, theme editors) is not included. Forms use default system styling.

### NG-008: Collaboration Features
Real-time collaborative editing, comments, or version control for multiple users working on the same form are not included.

### NG-009: Form Publishing/Hosting
Hosting completed forms or providing public URLs for form access is out of scope. Forms are exported for integration into existing applications.

### NG-010: Mobile Builder Interface
The builder interface is optimized for desktop use only. Responsive forms for mobile end-users are supported, but the builder itself requires desktop browsers.

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Technology Stack Integration

#### Required Integrations
- **Existing Tech Stack**: Must integrate with the current React-based application architecture
- **Data Format**: Must support existing data validation schemas and field type definitions
- **State Management**: Should align with existing state management patterns (Redux, Context API, or similar)

#### Component Architecture
- **Component Engine**: Extensible component system allowing future component types to be added without major refactoring
- **Form State Engine**: Centralized state management for all form operations (actions: CREATE_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT, ADD_TO_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT, DISSOLVE_HORIZONTAL_LAYOUT, MOVE_ROW_LAYOUT, etc.)
- **Drag-Drop Service**: Handles all drag-drop logic, position detection, and layout transformations

### 7.2 Data Structures

#### Component Schema
```typescript
interface FormComponentData {
  type: ComponentType;
  id: string;              // Unique component identifier
  fieldId: string;         // For data collection
  label: string;
  required: boolean;
  validation: ValidationRules;
  properties: Record<string, any>;
}
```

#### Horizontal Layout Schema
```typescript
interface HorizontalLayoutComponent {
  type: 'horizontal_layout';
  id: string;
  children: FormComponentData[];  // 2-4 components
  layoutConfig: {
    distribution: 'equal' | 'auto' | 'custom';
    spacing: 'tight' | 'normal' | 'loose';
    alignment: 'top' | 'center' | 'bottom';
  };
}
```

### 7.3 Performance Requirements
